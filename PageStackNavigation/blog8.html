				<p class="info">
			Its job is to convert the engine power into thrust, to pull/push the plane through the air.
				</p>
<br>


				<p class="info">
			The twist in the propeller is there to create the essential AoA, just like a wing has an AoA. The twist is greater towards the hub of the prop of varying airspeeds along the length of the blades, and hence varying thrust generation
The difference occurs because the outer tips of the prop move faster than the inner tips, thus the AoA has to change accordingly.

<h2>Size Labelling
</h2>

				<p class="info">
			RC propellers are designated with two measurements(both in inches):
			<ul class="info">
<li>Diameter (1st no.)</li>
<li>Pitch (2nd no.)</li>			</ul>

				</p>
			

				<p class="info">
			<strong>Diameter</strong> of the imaginary disc created by the spinning prop i.e. the length of prop from tip to tip.




				</p>
				<br>
				

				<p class="info">
			<strong>Pitch</strong> measurement of a prop indicates how far that prop will move through the air per single revolution of the engine (i.e. every single complete turn of the prop).

Thus, higher the pitch, faster the plane will go.

				<h2>Basic Propeller Principles
</h2>

				<p class="info">
			
			<ul class="info">
<li>The propeller blades are like airfoils and produce forces that create the thrust to pull or push.
 

 </li>
<li>
Pitch or Blade Angle is the angle between the chord of the blade and the plane of rotation. Thus, higher the blade angle, higher is the pitch.
 </li>

 

 

 

 <li>

Also, every fixed pitch propeller is a compromise, because it can only be efficient at only a given combination of airspeed and RPM.</li>
<li>The angle at which the air (relative wind) strikes the prop blade is called the Angle of Attack (AoA). The air deflection produced by this angle causes the pressure at the engine side to be greater than the atmospheric pressure, thus creating thrust.
 
</li>
<li>
The propeller shape also creates the thrust. As the air flows past the propeller, the pressure on one side is less than the other. Propeller, which is mounted in a vertical instead of a horizontal plane (wings), there is a decreased pressure in front of the propeller, and the force (thrust) is in the forward direction.
 </li>
<li>
Aerodynamically, thrust is the result of two things: <strong>Propeller Shape</strong> and <strong>
Angle of Attack</strong>
</li>		
<li>Another way to consider thrust, is in terms of mass of air handled by the propeller.
 </li>
<li>
On an average, thrust constitutes 80% of the torque (total horsepower absorbed by propeller) and rest 20% is lost in friction and slippage.
 </li>
<li>
For a single revolution of the propeller, the amount of air handled depends on the blade angle, which determines how big a “bite” of air the propeller takes. Thus, the blade angle is an excellent means of adjusting the load on the propeller to control the engine RPM.
</li>
<li>
Moreover, larger the diameter, more the mass of air can be displaced and thus, greater thrust. But larger diameter reduces the engine’s RPM at any given power setting.</li><li>
The blade angle must be adjusted to provide the most efficient AoA at all engine and airplane speeds. Lift v/s drag curves, indicate that the most efficient AoA is small one varying from 2-4 positive degrees.</li><li>
Propeller efficiency varies from 50% to 87%, depending on how much the propeller slips.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Propeller Slip

</h2>

				<p class="info">
			Propeller slip is the difference between the geometric pitch of the propeller and its effective pitch. Geometric pitch is the theoretical distance a propeller should advance in one revolution; effective pitch is the distance it actually advances. Thus, geometric or theoretical pitch is based on no slippage, but actual or effective pitch includes propeller slippage in the air.
				</p>
				<h2>Twist of the Propeller Blade



</h2>

				<p class="info">
			To put it another way, propeller blades are twisted to change the blade angle in proportion to the differences in speed of rotation along the length of the propeller and thereby keep thrust more nearly equalized along this length.

	<h2>Number of Blades of Propeller


</h2>

				<p class="info">
		<ul class="info"><li>	Adding more blades decreases the overall efficiency of the prop because each blade has to cut through more turbulent air from the preceding blade – in fact a single bladed propeller is the most efficient but these are rarely used. Incidentally a single bladed prop has to be balanced with a counterweight on the other side of the hub to the blade, otherwise the plane would shake itself to pieces as soon as the prop was turning! (There would be lot of vibrations)
 </li>
 <li>

Reason to use more than three blades is to reduce vibration. If a propeller is in the habit of producing annoying, rhythmic thumping and humming, a propeller with more blades will often solve the problem.</li>
<li>
Conclusion: the less number of blades the more efficiency, the higher number of blades the smoothest and uniform performance.</li><li>
If you would like to replace a 2 blade prop with a 3 or 4 blade, then the general rule is:
 <ol>
 <li>

Reduce the diameter by 1 or 2 inches</li><li>
Increase the pitch by 1 or 2 inches.</li>
 
</ol>
</li>
<li>
The increased pitch should overcome the increased drag of the extra blade(s).
	</li>		</ul>	</p>

<h2>Material of the Propeller
</h2>

				<p class="info">
		<ul class="info">	Options available are: Metal, Wood, Composite
<li>
 

Metal props are heavier than the other two types. Wooden and composite propellers dampen the engine vibration much better which may lead to reduced blade failures. Metal can handle rain and the odd stone better.
 
</li><li>
 

Wooden propellers are probably the cheapest, composites can be more expensive than wood as layers of carbon or glass and epoxy.
 </li>
<li>
Moreover, the wooden blades are more susceptible to breakage during an imperfect landing.
 </li>
 	</ul>	</p>

<p class="info">Note: In multi-engined aircraft, closer engine spacing is maintained, thus reducing the structural weight of the wing to a minimum.</p>
